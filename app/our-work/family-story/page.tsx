          The Evergreen Family Story Project is an inspiring initiative designed
          to preserve the cultural heritage and personal histories of families,
          passed down through generations. By involving students and young
          adults in the family in documenting the stories of their elders, the
          project fosters meaningful inter-generational connections, allowing
          for the exchange of life experiences, wisdom, and traditions. Through
          personal interviews, narrative creation, and multimedia storytelling,
          we aim to build an expandable family history archive.

          Interviewees Is The Owners of Their Stories
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Evergreen Family Story Project ensures the interviewees retain
          control over their narratives. These interviews and other family
          records reflect the perspectives of the interviewee and their family.
          While the interview files are archived by EEF, the family—particularly
          the interviewee—retains control over who, aside from EEF staff, can
          access the files and under what circumstances.

          To Empower Students and Young Adults as Interviewers
        </h2>
        <p>
          Enhances students and young adults skills and knowledge as
          interviewers. When students take on the role of interviewers, they
          gain valuable skills such as conducting interviews, identifying key
          themes, and writing concise summaries. Additionally, they learn to
          appreciate the educational differences between their own experiences
          and those of the interviewees, fostering a deeper understanding of
          generational perspectives. To Understand Through the Lens of Family
          History Enables interviewers to empathize with the unique challenges
          and triumphs of their family elders. By listening to their stories, we
          can better understand the struggles they faced in coming to and living
          in the United States, as seen through the lens of individual family
          experiences.
