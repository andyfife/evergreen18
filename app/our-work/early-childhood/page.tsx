          To Improve Access To Early Childhood Development Opportunities
        </h2>
        <p>
          Evergreen Education Foundation (EEF) is funding The Community
          Parenting and Play Center Project. The main project objectives are to
          support the early childhood development of children 1-6 years of age,
          who live in rural areas. EEF is dedicated to improving access to
          learning opportunities of high quality for children and young adults
          in rural and low-income areas in China. Historically, EEF has funded
          projects focused primarily on middle and high school students. EEF is
          delighted to fund a project, which is based on current research and
          has great potential as a model for improving the long-term prospects
          for the youngest children in rural China.

          Results from many studies in the last decade indicate that the most
          effective action to reduce inequality is to invest in programs that
          target the youngest children, who are growing up without the basic
          nutrition and interactions with parents and other caregivers that
          promote the development of cognitive and social skills. The Project
          will establish 2 Parenting and Play Centers in 2 villages in Tengchong
          City, Yunnan Province, China; recruit and train an instructor for each
          Center, provide a wide range of toys and books to provide a place for
          parents and caregivers to interact with children and for education
          activities, such as reading books to children; and promote the
          development of early childhood education through Center activities and
          home visits. Project activities also include training of parents and
          other caregivers assessments of children, and 4 semi-annual progress
          reports covering such topics as activities and training, challenges
          and solutions, community impact, and lessons learned. At least 60
          children and their families will participate in the project. Planet
          Aid (a US-based NGO) will administer and monitor the Project through
          its partner, Humana People to People’s representative office in
          Yunnan, which is responsible for implementing, monitoring, evaluating,
          and advocating this project.

          The Scientific Parenting and Child Development Program, supported by
          the Evergreen Education Foundation, spans two years from June 2024 to
          May 2026. The project aims to explore support models suitable for the
          growth and development of children aged 1-4 in rural areas, promoting
          scientific parenting concepts and knowledge to local families and
          governments, thereby positively impacting children’s growth. The
          project has established two parent-child activity centers in Xinglong
          Village and Sanlian Village, Mazhan Township, Tengchong City, Yunnan
          Province. These centers are equipped with furniture, toys, books, and
          activity materials to aid child development, and have each hired
          activity center Parenting Guides. Preparatory work took place from
          July to September 2024. The project carried out a needs assessment,
          recruitment and pre-service training of activity center parenting
          guides, as well as material procurement. The Xinglong and Sanliand
          parent-child activity centers officially opened on September 14, 2024.
          The centers operate four days a week, five hours a day. By the end of
          December 2024, they had been open for 120 days, totaling 605 hours.
          Fifty children participated in the center activities, with a total of
          1,258 participatory events by the children.
