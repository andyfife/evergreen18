          Beyond Creating Initiatives and Developing Projects
        </h2>
        <p>
          Evergreen Education Foundation is not only project-focused; we are
          also dedicated to research, impact assessment, presentations, and
          publications. We collaborate with rural teachers and librarians to
          ensure their voices are included in global educational conversations.
          This partnership leads to co-authored papers presented at
          international conferences such as IFLA and IASL, and published in
          reputable, peer-reviewed journals like Library Trends. By empowering
          local educators to share their experiences and insights, we contribute
          to a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of education
          challenges and opportunities in rural communities. Our approach
          bridges practical project implementation with rigorous research,
          ensuring that the impact of our work is thoroughly documented and
          shared. This model enhances the visibility of rural educators,
          promotes sustainable knowledge exchange, and strengthens our
          collective commitment to educational equity and innovation. Through
          these efforts, Evergreen Education Foundation not only transforms
          local education but also shapes the global conversation on learning.

          School Libraries in Rural Western China Serve Local Needs.” Library
          Trends 62, no. 1 (2013): 205-233. This report presents a case study of
          school library programs in two rural counties in Western China. Since
          2002, the libraries of Tianzhu and Tongwei high schools have
          undertaken a series of outreach initiatives to improve local
          residents’ access to information and to address their cultural and
          educational needs. Over the past decade, both school libraries have
          played a leading role in improving the quality of life and enhancing
          the information literacy of local residents. Tianzhu No. 1 High School
          Library 天祝一中图书馆—which serves a large Tibetan and other minority
          populations—has gained a reputation for its oral history of local
          culture program. This program trains students to conduct interviews
          with folk artists and scholars and then post their audiovisual
          recordings on websites. Tongwei No. 1 High School Library
          通渭一中图书馆 is known for providing health care information through
          both in-person workshops and online. Recently, it implemented a
          tutoring service aimed at teaching residents to use online resources.
          These programs have been successful and sustainable in part because of
          the sponsorship and funding of the U.S.-based Evergreen Education
          Foundation (EEF) 美国青树教育基金会. This report analyzes the results
          of these major initiatives, both of which do a great deal to reach out
          to rural residents, particularly farmers and the elderly.

          This article examines a “glocal” community informatics project that is
          transforming villages in Western China. Funded and initiated by the
          U.S.-based Evergreen Education Foundation (EEF)—an organization that
          makes public computing resources available to the digital poor and
          digital extremely poor communities—the project supports the
          establishment of public computing sites in primary and middle schools,
          thereby improving villagers’ digital consciousness and digital
          literacy. This study uses a digital inequality model—organized around
          a pyramid of five classes comprising the digital elite, the digital
          rich, the digital middle class, the digital poor, and the digital
          extremely poor—to assess the impact of this project. The authors found
          that, on the whole, the EEF’s training programs helped people move up
          the pyramid of digital inequality.
