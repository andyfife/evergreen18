          The Household Small Hands-On Project Site aims to enhance literacy
          through household library services in rural communities by developing
          innovative, community-driven programs. These projects aim to serve
          local children based on their demographics, education levels,
          interests, and daily lives. Each project follows a one-year cycle.
          Projects cover a variety of themes, including but not limited to:
          Reading Promotion & Engagement such as book-sharing sessions,
          parent-child reading activities, reading mentorship programs, themed
          reading events, mobile book bags, book exchange markets, and emotional
          well-being stations; Interdisciplinary Activities Linked to Reading
          such as hands-on science projects, nature education, arts and crafts,
          vocational and health education, traditional culture workshops, and
          STEM activities; Cultural Heritage & Community Service such as folk
          culture exhibitions, local history preservation initiatives, and
          community storytelling archives.

          EEF is funding Peking University Professor Zizhou Wang’s Household
          Reading Site (HRS) project, which aims to increase reading access and
          improve reading, science, technology, health, and cultural literacy
          among rural children by placing shelves of books and small project
          toolkits in selected rural families and establishing neighborhood
          reading centers in Chinese villages. The HRS project seeks to tackle
          an increasingly dire social problem that accompanies China’s rapid
          urbanization – the crisis of “left-behind” children. In search of
          better job opportunities, many rural adults migrate to cities and
          leave their children behind. There are about 70 million left-behind
          children in China, and they experience various effects of poverty,
          including poor quality of education. This program fosters literacy,
          creativity, and community engagement, empowering rural children with
          diverse learning opportunities while preserving local culture.

          Researchers from the Stanford Rural Education Action Program found
          that almost half of the left-behind children in the poorest central
          and western parts of China had dropped out of school by Grade 9. They
          cautioned that the high dropout rates may increase unemployment and
          widen inequality, which could lead to serious implications nationally
          and even internationally. One manifestation of disparities in
          education is rural children’s significant lack of access to suitable
          and adequate reading materials to develop their reading skills and
          interests. More than 70% of children in impoverished rural areas had
          access to only 10 or fewer extracurricular books a year, and nearly
          20% had none. Recognizing this barrier in reading and literacy
          development, the HRS project aims to make reading materials easily
          accessible to rural children by creating neighborhood reading centers
          in selected households. HRS has identified a total of 15 villages to
          implement the intervention. At each village, 5 households are selected
          to receive a bookshelf and age-appropriate reading materials for
          children in that household and neighboring families. Selected families
          are trained on how to run the household-based library to offer
          convenient access to books and foster a culture of reading among
          neighborhood children.
